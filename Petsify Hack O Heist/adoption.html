    <div class="container">“Adopt, don’t shop” is a campaign slogan encouraging people to adopt dogs from shelters or rescues rather than purchasing a dog from a breeder or puppy mill.</div>
    <div class="container">Every time an animal is adopted, a space opens up in the shelter or the rescue. So when you adopt a cat or dog, not only are you saving that animal’s life, but you are also opening up a space for another animal’s life to be saved.</div>

        Adopting a pet from an animal shelter or rescue group is a wonderful way to save a life. There are organizations in every city and small town that work to find homes for strays, young animals, and pets that owners just can’t take care of anymore. You can find pretty much every age, breed mix, size, and personality if you know where to look and are patient enough. When you adopt, you also open up space for another furry friend to be rescued. And, generally speaking, adoption is generally less expensive and more ethical than getting a pet from a breeder.

    <h3>
        ADOPT INDIE DOGS! <i class="fa fa-paw"></i>
    </h3>
    <p class="col">
        The streets have played a significant role in the evolution of Indie dogs. They are highly alert and quite literally street smart.
        They adapt well to new places, and based on several people’s experiences, they are easier to train. Although as a territorial breed, they may react with aggression to unknown dogs or people as adults, socialisation helps keep their cool.
        Indies are primarily known for their territorial nature, which makes them good watchdogs.
    <br>
    But their generally cheerful and social nature makes them very lovable among people, and even develop a strong bond of loyalty with their family and owners.
    <br>
    We have taken measures to vaccinate them and it is absolutely safe to make them a part of your family!
    <br>
    Love an Indie dog, and they’ll love you back in abundance.
